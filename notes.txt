Design Considerations & Notes

Assumptions:
* Environment: Assumes access to Google Cloud Vertex AI.
* Data: The NG12 PDF is the sole source of truth for the RAG pipeline.

Trade-offs:
* In-Memory Session Store: For the chat feature, session history is stored in memory.
 In a production environment, this would be replaced with a persistent store 
 (e.g., Redis or Firestore) to allow for stateless scaling and durability.
* PDF Parsing: The current PyPDFLoader is efficient but may struggle with complex 
tables found in medical docs. A production iteration might use Google 
Cloud Document AI for higher fidelity extraction.
* Security: API authentication was omitted to focus on the core logic.

Future Improvements:
* Evaluation: Implement an automated evaluation pipeline (using tools like Ragas) to benchmark 
the accuracy of retrieval and generation.
* Hybrid Search: Combine vector search with keyword search (BM25) to better handle specific 
medical terminology.
* Frontend: Decouple the UI into a separate React/Next.js application for better user experience.
